# Patreon API tests

Patreon API fetch tests. Might make into library someday.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. `npm i` (Needs [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed.)

3. Create a `*.env` file in root with the following values:
	```
	PORT = localhost port to use
	CLIENT_ID = CLIENT_ID from registered client
	CLIENT_SECRET = CLIENT_SECRET from registered client
	```

4. Run by hitting `F5`, or through `npm run webpack && node dist/index.js`
